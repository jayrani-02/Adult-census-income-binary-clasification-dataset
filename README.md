Discription:
   The adult income dataset that involves predicting personal income levels as above or below 50K than above $50K, although the skew is not severe.This means that techniques for imbalanced classification can be used whilst model performance can still be reported using classification accuracy, as is used with balanced classification problems.
    Using predefined train and test sets, reported good classification error is approximately 14 percent or a classification accuracy of about 86 percent. This might provide a target to aim for when working on this dataset
